Considering characteristics such as data capacity, access speed, volatility, read-only or read-write,
the modern computer architecture uses HDDs or SSDs to store permanent data, and RAM for intermediate data.

Programs will load files from the HDD or SSD to RAM, use RAM to calculate, and store necessary data in files on the HDD or SSD. 

RAM is accessed frequently from programs, and therefore it is called the “main memory”. 

In practical programming environments, when we use the word “memory”, we often mean RAM.

Given RAM and HDD where the access speed is 10 GB/s and 100 MB/s respectively, we want to read a 3MB file 25 times. 

Ignoring random access overhead and the cost of writing to RAM, which answer is correct regarding the speed of (A) and (B)?

(A) load the file from the HDD to RAM once, and read from RAM 25 times.
(B) read directly from the HDD 25 times.

Answer

10 GB/s is equivalent to 10000 10000 MB/s.

Loading a 3 MB file once from the 100 MB/s HDD takes 3 / 100 = 0.03 s, whereas

loading a 3 MB file once from the 10000 MB/s RAM takes 10000 = 0.0003 s.

(A) 1×0.03+25×0.0003=0.0375 s, while
(B) 25×0.03=0.75 s.

0.75 / 0.0375 = 20. Therefore, (A) is 20 times faster than (B).
