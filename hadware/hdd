The data access speed is fast for sequential accesses and becomes slower for random access.

Sequential access is reading or writing from a continuous chunk of data. Random access is reading or writing from different places on the disk.

Given an HDD where the sequential access speed is 100 100 MB/s, which has an overhead of 10 ms when accessing a different place (random access overhead), 
and assuming that files are placed randomly within the drive and each file is stored continuously without any fragmentation,

harddisk itu random access dalam pengalamatan atau memberi alamat pada storage atau penyimpanan.
harddisk cepat diakses ketika alamat sudah ditentukan,jadi setelah alamat nya sudah selesai dibuat maka kita menyimpannya,nah disini cepat

formula 

100 MB/s is 100000 kB/s, so without accounting for random access time, the time to read a file of N,N kilobytes is N/100000. 

Random access time is 10 ms, or 0.01 s, so the total time to access a single file of size N,N is N/100000 + 0.01 

For (A), accessing one 50 kB file including the random access overhead takes 0.01 + 50/100000 = 0.0105 s .

200 files will be a total of 200 * 0.0105 = 2.1 s .
